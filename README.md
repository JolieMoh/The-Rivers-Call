# About
_The River's Call_ is an up and coming third-person  narrative driven, cosy, platformer-adventure game set in the beautiful Australian Wilderness. You play as Henry, a flightless white-faced heron determined to migrate with the rest of his flock, even if he has to do it his own way. Experience a heartfelt story that explores themes of determination and friendship, explore gorgeous landscapes, and challenge yourself with the platformer levels as you progress through _The River's Call_.

Created by Charlee, Ali, Tiarna, Kai, and Jolie. Directed and produced by Griffith University.
